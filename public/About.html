<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a web developer currently seeking employment. With my education and work experience, 
    I am confident I can excel at [Company Name].
    As a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, where I completed my BA in
    Information Science, I have developed a strong foundation in various technical disciplines. My
    academic journey provided me with a comprehensive understanding of dynamic web
    applications, database design and modeling, object-oriented programming, and data sources
    and manipulations. Additionally, I possess excellent programming skills in languages such as
    Python, C, and Java and proficiency in front-end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<p> During my academic tenure, I undertook several notable projects that allowed me to
    apply my knowledge and showcase my problem-solving abilities. For instance, I developed a
    Python program that efficiently filtered and sorted data from a COVID-19 vaccination chart,
    demonstrating my proficiency in data cleaning and data manipulation. Moreover, I successfully
    designed and implemented an SQL database to categorize teas based on their popularity,
    brand, and quality. These experiences enhanced my skills in database design, attention to
    detail, and organization.

    Furthermore, I have hands-on experience in web development, having created a fully
    functional wireframe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This wireframe analyzed and mapped
    all the speed cameras in Prince George's County based on their proximity to nearby public
    schools, highlighting my ability to translate complex requirements into user-friendly interfaces.
    During my internship at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as part of the Marion Barry
    Summer Program, I served as an IT Intern, supporting the production of a project called SLED.
    In this role, I gained valuable experience creating prototypes for page layouts and giving
    proposal-style presentations. This opportunity honed my problem-solving skills, attention to
    detail, and ability to work in a team-oriented environment. I am also proficient in Microsoft Excel
    and Word and have experience with Git and GitHub for efficient version control.
